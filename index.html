I wake up in the middle of the night reaching for you, only to find empty space where your warmth should be. I realize now that I've been taking for granted the most precious gift life has given me - YOU.</p>

When you're angry with me, it feels like the sun has disappeared from my sky. I made the biggest mistake of my life by hurting you, and I will spend every day of my life making it right.</p>
                        
                        <p class="emotional-paragraph">I love you more than words can express. I love your laugh that makes my whole world light up. I love how you care for others with such pure kindness. I love the way you look at me with those beautiful eyes that hold my entire universe. I love every single thing about you, even the things that drive me crazy, because they're part of what makes you perfectly you.</p>
                        
                        <p class="emotional-paragraph">Without you, I am incomplete. Without you, I am lost. Without you, I am nothing. Please, my love, don't give up on us. Don't give up on me. I promise to be the man you deserve - patient, understanding, loving, and devoted to making you happy every single day.</p>
